# Project Title

#### Epicodus JavaScript Galactic Age Calculator

#### By Rita Bennett-Chew

## Description
JavaScript application that works with the Date object to return a user's age in different planet years
### Specs
Goal for 8/3/18: Build out the following business logic:
- Take a person’s date of birth and calculate the number of seconds since then.
  * input: year: 1974; month: 4; day: 15
  * output: number of seconds between 4/15/74 and now
- Compare two dates in seconds
  * input: year: 1974; month: 4; day: 15
  * input: year: 1996; month: 3; day: 28
  * output: # of seconds between 4/15/74 and 3/28/1996
- Calculate the average # of seconds in Earth years
- Calculate the number of seconds in a Mercury year, a Venus year, a Mars year, and a Jupiter year
- Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
- Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
- Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
- Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
- Collect information from the user and determine their life expectancy
- If they have passed their life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.
- If they have not passed their life expectancy, Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!)
